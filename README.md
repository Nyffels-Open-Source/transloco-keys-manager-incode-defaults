> 🦄 The Key to a Better Translation Experience

Translation is a tiresome and repetitive task. Each time we add new text, we need to create a new entry in the translation file, find the correct placement for it, etc. Moreover, when we delete existing keys, we need to remember to remove them from each translation file.

To make the process less burdensome, we've created two tools for the Transloco library, which will do the monotonous work for you.
